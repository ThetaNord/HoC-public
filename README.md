# Heroes of Chess

This is a public repository for my final project for the Studio 1 programming course of 2011-2012. It contains the full source code, all graphics and the Javadoc documentation of the project.

The game was designed to be a combination of chess and the Heroes of Might & Magic game series. All graphics and programming was done by me.
